Import unstructured text to a Qualified quiz.

### TODO

- Allow appending to an existing quiz
- Add more meta fields like difficulty
- set query params on submit
- could also accept chatGPT conversation URL as input
- could offer a userscript-created button in ChatGPT to pop open a new tab to run the request via query params
- alternate approach: run the backend on another server/localhost and have the button in ChatGPT send the request there to handle the API calls
